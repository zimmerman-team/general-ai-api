This would show a comparison of the budget for each country in the given year.\n2. Geo map: use \"country\" for the map and \"budget\" (sum) for the color coding to show the relative budget by country.\n3. Line chart: use \"year\" on the X-axis, \"country\" on the Y-axis, and \"budget\" for the lines. This would show a trend of budget over time by country.\n4. Treemap: use \"country\" for the hierarchy and \"budget\" (sum) for the size of each block. This would show a visual representation of the budget distribution by country.\n5. There is no fitting chart for \"step\" based visualizations with this data."}
