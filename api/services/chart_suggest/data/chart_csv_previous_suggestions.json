You can use all columns except quality and plot the heatmap to see which variables are correlated.\n\n5) Line chart: This can be used to visualize trends over time, but there is no time variable in this dataset.\n\nOverall, you should try using different chart types for different combinations of variables to see which one best highlights the patterns in the data."}
